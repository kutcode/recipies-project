        <h3><strong>A classic dish consisting of ground lamb and spices.</strong></h3>

        One of my favorite dishes from my childhood.
        <br>
        My go-to dish whenever I am trying to choose something at a Turkish restaurant.

        <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>500 Grams of ground lamb</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of ground sumac</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of ground urfa pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of ice-cold water</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4><strong>Instructions</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For the Kebabs: </strong>Combine lamb with 7.5 grams (about 2 teaspoons) kosher salt, 1 teaspoon cumin, 2 teaspoons sumac, and 1 tablespoon pepper<br>
                flakes. Knead by hand or in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until mixture turns tacky and starts sticking to the side of the<br>
                bowl. Add water and continue kneading until incorporated. Place in refrigerator and chill well.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine remaining teaspoon cumin, 2 teaspoons sumac, remaining tablespoon pepper flakes, and 2 teaspoons salt in a small bowl. <br>
                Set spice mixture aside. Combine remaining 2 teaspoons sumac and red onions in a medium bowl. Season with salt to taste and set aside.</li>
            <li>Using wet hands, divide lamb mixture into 12 even balls. Using wet hands, form each ball into a long, flat kebab around a skewer.</li>
            <li>Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of<br> 
                the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas<br> 
                grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place kebabs directly over hot side of<br> 
                grill, cover, and cook, turning occasionally and sprinkling with spice mixture until well charred on both sides and kebabs are cooked through, <br>
                about 12 minutes total.</li>
        </ol>
