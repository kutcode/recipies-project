        <h4><strong>Instructions: Making the Dough</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the flour to a large mixing bowl followed by the yeast and salt and combine.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir the warm water together with the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the middle of the flour with a spoon and pour the water and oil mixture into it.</li>
            <li>Blend the flour into the liquid by folding the dry ingredients from the sides into the center.</li>
            <li>Flour your work surface and your hands.</li>
            <li>Turn out the dough and knead it for about 15 minutes until the dough is soft and elastic.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a little bit of olive oil inside the mixing bowl and spread it around with your fingers to oil the inside.</li>
            <li>Put the dough back in the oiled bowl and cover it with a cloth or towel.</li>
            <li>Leave it in a warm place to rise for 30 to 45 minutes. The dough should rise to about double the size.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4><strong>Instructions: Making the Topping</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>While the dough rises, prepare the topping. Gather the topping ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4><strong>Instructions: Making the Lahmacun</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 F. Put a large a nonstick sheet tray into the oven to preheat.</li>
            <li>Turn out the dough on a floured surface and divide it into 6 even pieces.</li>
            <li>Roll out each piece into a very thin round or oval shape. Try to get each one as thin as possible without tearing it.</li>
            <li>Spread the topping thinly and evenly over the top of each dough round with your fingers. Don’t press down too hard.</li>
            <li>Remove the sheet tray from the oven (with oven mitts) and carefully place each lahmacun on it. Don’t allow them to overlap.</li>
            <li>Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the topping is sizzling, and the edges of the dough are brown. Always check the lahmacuns as they <br>
                cook to prevent them from burning.</li>
            <li>Serve the lahmacuns piping hot with lemon wedges for squeezing and a plate of sliced onions mixed with sumac and sprigs of Italian parsley.</li>
        </ol>
