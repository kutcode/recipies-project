        <h3><strong>A classic dessert dish that will excite your taste buds.</strong></h3>

        One of my favorite Turkish desserts from my childhood.
        <br>
        My go-to dessert whenever I am trying to choose something at a Turkish restaurant.

        <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs puff pastry sheets</li>
            <li>4 cups pistachios (shelled, coarsely minced)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 cups melted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup finely minced pistachios (, to garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4><strong>Instructions</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll all 4 puff pastry sheets to fit a 9 x 11 baking dish; set aside. <br>
                Grease pan with room temperature butter. Place 1 rolled sheet of puff pastry into pan then grease pastry sheet with butter. Place another <br>
                layer of puff pastry on top, then grease with butter. </li>
            <li>In medium bowl, combine coarsely chopped pistachios, honey, sugar and water and mix. Pour mixture over puff pastry sheets in dish. <br>
                Place another puff pastry sheet over the top of the mixture, then grease it with butter. Place the last puff pastry on top and pour remaining <br>
                 butter on top. Use a sharp knife to cut baklava in the shape of a diamond or square. </li>
            <li>Place baklava in oven and bake for 90 minutes. The top of the puff pastry should be light golden color and the papers should appear crispy. <br>
                Meanwhile, grind or chop the remaining pistachios into an almost fine dust or finely chopped. Allow baklava to cool then garnish with pistachios. </li>
        </ol>
