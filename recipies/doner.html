        <h3><strong>A classic sandwich consisting of sliced ground lamb and spices/veggies.</strong></h3>

        One of my favorite Turkish street foods.
        <br>
        My go-to comfort dish whenever I am trying to choose something to pick up on the street in Turkey.

        <h4><strong>Ingredients: For the Kebab</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground lamb (or 1/2 pound each of ground lamb and ground beef)</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>4 clove garlic, peeled and finely minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil, more for the pan</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Ingredients: For the Sandwich</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large pita, naan, or flatbread</li>
            <li>1 cup assorted lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 medium English cucumber, sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 large red onion, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>Tzatziki sauce or tahini sauce</li> 
        </ul>
        
        <h4><strong>Instructions</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pre heat the oven to 350 F. In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb, egg, garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika, dried <br>
                oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the mixture into an oiled 9 x 5-inch loaf pan and cook in the oven for approximately 30 minutes or until the top is a light golden brown.</li>
            <li>You can slice the loaf immediately if you like but, for best results, cool completely, wrap in aluminum foil, and refrigerate until firm.</li>
            <li>To reheat, add a little olive oil to a large skillet, slice the loaf very thinly and crisp up the slices in the hot pan for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Assemble the sandwiches with pita, warmed and toasted through. Spread on some tzatziki or tahini sauce, add lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, <br>
                and top with more sauce.</li>
        </ol>
