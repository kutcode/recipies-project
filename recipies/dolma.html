        <h3><strong>A classic Turkish appetizer that will leave you wanting more.</strong></h3>

        One of my favorite light and tasty Turkish appetizers.
        <br>
        My go-to starter whenever I am trying to decide on something at a Turkish restaurant.

        <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb pickled grape leaves, pickled in brine then washed and drained</li>
            <li>4 medium onions, diced</li>
            <li>2 cups rice, washed under cold water and drained</li>
            <li>1⁄2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1⁄3 cup pine nuts</li>
            <li>1⁄4 cup dried currant</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried mint flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon allspice</li>
            <li>1⁄8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1⁄8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon salt</li>
            <li>1⁄2 lemon, juice of</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4><strong>Instructions</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the onions and sauté with 1/4 cup of olive oil.</li>
            <li>When they turn translucent, add the pine nuts and sauté for 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add rice and stir constantly for 5-10 minutes until the rice is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the spices (dried mint, cinnamon, lemon salt, black pepper, dried currants, sugar and allspice) and chopped parsley.</li>
            <li>After another quick stir, add 1/2 cup of boiling water and simmer on low medium heat for 15-20 minutes until all the liquid is <br>
                absorbed by the rice mixture.</li>
            <li>Take off heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>And now, here comes the fun part. Traditionally, you would put a spoonful of the cooled mixture in the center of the top part of the leaf, <br>
                fold the sides inwards and then roll the leaf like a cylinder. But since I have “The Ultimate Dolma Machine” (follow the link mentioned in the <br>
                description section), I just placed a leaf on the rubber compartment of the machine, put a tbps of mixture in the middle and with a single slide, <br>
                there comes my dolma from the other side of the machine. The process was a breeze. It took me only 10 minutes to roll nearly 40 perfectly shaped <br>
                dolmas. Below is the process fully photographed.</li>
            <li>As the final step, spread a layer of vine leaves on the bottom of a large and heavy pot (to prevent the stuffed leaves from burning).</li>
            <li>Lay all your dolmas side by side and tuck very tightly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the remaining 1/4 cups of olive oil, juice of half a lemon and 2 cups of boiling water, cover with a plate upside down <br>
                (so that the dolmas don’t move around in boiling water) and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until all the water is absorbed (roughly 45-60 minutes).</li>
            <li>Transfer to your serving dish and let cool.</li>
        </ol>
